# main-site
Largest project

Basically just a project that showcases/links to all of the other ones. Has an about me page with a bit of information, a contact form,
and also includes a small store application. The majority of things are located in the 'newsletter' app, with the store using the shop, cart, and Celery. The newsfeed is news_list. 

This website is going to be an ongoing process with me updating with relevant projects/information as I go.
